This is a machine learning library developed by Sujay Tripathy for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah.

There are two decision tree algorithms right now. ID3 for the car data, and ID3Bank for the bank data.

Both of them can be called as; <br />
 $python3 ID3.py <depth of tree> <br />
 $python3 ID3Bank.py <depth of tree>
